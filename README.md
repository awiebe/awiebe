### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My github is not so interesting because it just shows the public commit activty for what is often private repos.  Now and then I will open a PR against a project I'm trying to use, but if you're here for business enquiries I recommend my [portfolio](https://sites.google.com/view/awiebe/home) instead
